## Description
This is my second project created in the process of becoming the Frontend Developer. I have created a simple currency conventer that allows you to exchange Polish currency PLN into some other currencies.
## How it works
At the beginning you need to enter your amount of money in PLN, then you can select the currency from the list you want to convert into. To get the result, you need to click the 'Przelicz' button.
